TODO: Write Weekly Feedback Summary; Overall Summary; My personal favorites; And responses to critiques 

Week 1
------

* "Ambitious founder with a crazy interesting and weird idea. If it works would be transformative!"
* "Its important to be able to trust AI, snd moral can help us with that."
* "The idea is at least different."
* "Very relevant "
* "I love this idea, I'm obsessed with the idea of how a person's ideas can persist beyond their lifetime."
* "More inclined towards ethics n philosophy!"
* "Sounds very interesting and necessary in the time weâ€™re currently living in, "
* "I'm very invested in this problem as well"
* "ambitious"


Week 2
------

* "Nice look on the new sides of yourself as a professional"
* "I really like that you've cleaned the data and can have the algorithm running and learning all the time"
* "This is incredibly important work, but please include philosophers who are women, people of color, or who are from "non dominant" countries"
* "Love love the premise of your project!"
* "I like the idea of Building Ethical AI: Using moral philosophy texts and machine learning, recreate the ethical viewpoint of a philosopher."
* "This is technical in nature"
* "I like the idea, but you're not really constructing their viewpoint. You're emulating their speech. My bet is the system breaks w/ new data."
* "be human is what matters most . Thanks you for pointing it out"
* "Fun project! I'm a fan of Karl Popper myself. Morality isn't really about generating words, but deciding 'what to do next'. Still, neat! :)"
* "Combining philosophy and AI is very cool. Fast progress. Google's Colaboratory could be used to run 12h-long tests on the cloud for free."
* "Cool concept. The more AI becomes widespread, we will need these so Sky Net doesn't kill us."
* ""A" project resonated with me since it's something that would help much if executed well. Machines being able to answer complex questions."
* "AI will help advance our world, we can learn a lot from it. And it can learn a lot from us."
