Pioneer.app Voting
==================

I'm very happy & grateful with the number of increasing votes (or ratio of votes) week over week! 
**9 &rarr; 13 &rarr; 18 &rarr; 15 &rarr; 16!**

If you've voted for me, and you're reading this:

### THANK YOU!  
_Note: I want us to __both__ be in the competition so please wait until after the competition to contact me as that violates the rules!_

TODO: Overall Summary

Voting Format
-------------

Each Pioneer is shown two anonymous applicants (A, B) where they "vote" on which one is better.
Then, a prompt of "What did you like about the applicant you voted for?" with a capped length.

The last few weeks they've shown the number of upvotes and downvotes. 
18:13 &rarr; 15:10 &rarr; 16:10 (increasing the ratio from 1.38:1 &rarr; 1.5:1 &rarr; 1.6:1)
Therefore, my project was shown 31 &rarr; 25 &rarr; 26 times. 
This decrease in the total number of votes strengthens (doesn't reliably prove by any means) 
one of my personal hypotheses. 
Namely, that the overall number of Pioneers _still_ participating in the tournament has decreased.

Application Feedback
--------------------

Fellow Pioneers said this is ambitious and that they are interested in this idea as it's weird, crazy, different, relevant.  

I really liked the "how a person's ideas can persist beyond their lifetime" comment.  

And from the last comment, I decided to change the phrasing my project. My aim is to have this seen as machine learning
on ethics & philosophy as opposed to "the ethics of machine learning."  

* "Ambitious founder with a crazy interesting and weird idea. If it works would be transformative!"
* "Its important to be able to trust AI, snd moral can help us with that."
* "The idea is at least different."
* "Very relevant "
* "Sounds very interesting and necessary in the time weâ€™re currently living in, "
* "I'm very invested in this problem as well"
* "ambitious"
* "I love this idea, I'm obsessed with the idea of how a person's ideas can persist beyond their lifetime."
* "More inclined towards ethics n philosophy!"


Week 1
------

Fellow Pioneers were more critical this round, which I welcome. From the _Critiques_ section, the first comment
would prefer for this project to include those a diverse set of moral philosophers. 
The scope of my project is to focus on Kant's views. 
However, this is all open source so others may include any philosopher.

From the 2nd and 3rd comment in the _Critiques_ section, I'm emulating speech / generating words (paraphrasing).
I completely agree. My research aim is to be able to better understand how a machine can "learn" ethics, generate a summary,
and decide/make/deduce morality. When AGI (not if) happens, it is necessary we may communicate effectively between one another.   

The funniest comment was the first comment in the _Motivating_ section.

#### Critiques
* "This is incredibly important work, but please include philosophers who are women, people of color, or who are from "non dominant" countries"
* "I like the idea, but you're not really constructing their viewpoint. You're emulating their speech. My bet is the system breaks w/ new data."
* "Fun project! I'm a fan of Karl Popper myself. Morality isn't really about generating words, but deciding 'what to do next'. Still, neat! :)"
#### Motivating
* "Cool concept. The more AI becomes widespread, we will need these so Sky Net doesn't kill us."
* "Combining philosophy and AI is very cool. Fast progress. Google's Colaboratory could be used to run 12h-long tests on the cloud for free."
* ""A" project resonated with me since it's something that would help much if executed well. Machines being able to answer complex questions."
* "AI will help advance our world, we can learn a lot from it. And it can learn a lot from us."
* "be human is what matters most . Thanks you for pointing it out"
#### Purely Positive
* "Nice look on the new sides of yourself as a professional"
* "I really like that you've cleaned the data and can have the algorithm running and learning all the time"
* "I like the idea of Building Ethical AI: Using moral philosophy texts and machine learning, recreate the ethical viewpoint of a philosopher."
* "This is technical in nature"
* "Love love the premise of your project!"


Week 2
------

From first comment in the _Questions_ section, it is similar to last weeks critique of having diverse set of moral philosophers. 
The scope of my project is to focus on Kant's views. However, this is all open source so others may include any philosopher.
Lastly, I may expand my project to include more philosophers. 
As of now, I believe focusing on one text by one philosopher within one normative ethical theory to be the best path for success
within this tournament (ending at the end of September 2018). 
I think adding various viewpoints to be a serious endeavor both in terms of time and in importance.

From the second _Question_, metrics for success are Precision, Recall, F-1, and a "grading" system. The grading portion requires human intervention from experts.
I intend to use some of the proceeds to 1) Generate more human-generated summaries of various texts and 
2) Have philosophers "grade" machine-generate summaries. An informal metric for success is my placement in the Pioneer Tournament.

From the last _Question_, my code is freely available and purposefully designed to be able to be replicated. 
I think the diversity problem could be related to this question.

I found the first two comments in the _Motivating_ section to be very empowering!
One person had another nearly equal project to vote for yet chose mine. 
And, the second person voted for me twice thus showing they remembered me. 

#### Questions
* "This is a huge issue. How will you address the variances in cultures?"
* "I like the concept. What are your metrics of success?"
* "Interesting idea... how could what you're doing be used by another project?"
#### Motivating
* "That was hard , but you're definitely worth it"
* "You received my vote twice! :) I hope this will help your fantastic project"
* "Interesting idea and would like to see how this gets further developed in the future. Looking forward to next week's progress."
* "Maybe will solve inequality."
#### Purely Positive
* "AI is cool, and ethics will underline its' adoption. also, your competitor put in zero effort. "
* "You're following the right path! Very good luck! Fantastic project :)"
* "Crazy idea, but important"
* "The aspect that deals with AI"
* "great effort"
* "Great update!"
* "Good progress"
* "Really interesting concept!"
* "applicant seems self aware."
* "AI + ethics seems like a very cool idea."
* "Really interesting project and love the way you let your inner critic know who is boss!"

Week 3
------

What's really interesting about this week's feedback is that multiple people mentioned Kant.
In the previous weeks, no one acknowledged him even though I had directly mentioned him. 
I wonder if choosing Kant (over Bentham/Mill, Aristotle etc.) polarizes the Pioneer voters.
As in, what if the Pioneer population doesn't prescribe to deontology? Or, Kant? Or, philosophy more generally?

I've also been experimenting with _how_ I submit my weekly progress. This week I used bullet points for the first time.
From Week 1 to now, I've experimented with the "Summary Sentence" as I recognize I instantly compare A and B based on their
"Summary Sentence" 

#### Motivating
* "Fascinating project from a unique, world class builder. If I could give suggestion for philosophers: Zera Yacob, the stoics (Seneca, etc)" - galahad
* "I can't decide which is more amazing: reading Kant in a week or summarizing it in 100 words!" - prendalearning
* "Not only do you have an interesting idea/ product, but you also seem like a great person as well! Love effective altruism." - Art3mis
#### Purely Positive (one exception)
* "Wow! Good work. General AI doesn't feel to be too far away :)" - VC
* "I think you are doing very well on your project. I hope you get a good result on your project." - chic0815
* "Great idea!" - dumbledore-802321
* "I liked how you use AI. I hope one day we are ruled by AI." - haydar
* "The problem you are trying to solve is extremely interesting, and it seems like you understand balance!" - JohnTaylorTucker
* "Ethics in AI is sorely needed ... " - Graham
* "Kant is most ethical person we could ever find, at least heard of." - MichaelRoss

* "Really interesting Machines to learn ethics" - Tochi
* "Sounds better than the other but not particularly attainable" - akibet

Week 4
------

I wasn't able to fully decode the encoding problem found in the Stanford researcher's code. 
It turns out the scripts Bajaj created breaks in Python 2.7 and in Python 3+ (even after using the `2to3` package).
So, my progress didn't have a "WOW" factor. However, my ratio of upvotes did increase yet my rank fell.

#### Motivating
* "Programming can have a lot of nuanced issues. I like the github page description of your aims." - johannes
* "I like the challenge of a ethical AI. Sam Harris's moral landscape might be useful reading." - killermann
* "How do you measure something is ethical or not?" - mulan-yoda
* "You have to learn the general theory of reflexivity to pre compile the bias AoT to train your data set." - Waterboy
* "More focussed and determined. Trying to improve the product. Keep up the good show." - saurabhjindal
* "Please, take a look at the Ethigs group from IEEE, Edson Prestes leads the group and they will be happy to help you!" - dt
* "Applicant understand the importance of failure and learning from said experience. They are also demonstrating great progress." - Edward_W_Hood
* "Impressive progress. I recommend dumbing down answers a little bit. Also tread carefully with AI ðŸ˜¬" - TheStateofFlow
* "Although this could have some bias, given the different social and philosophical perspectives, the project seems amazing..." - jormax23
* "Very cool. Please continue. Perhaps, when the time is right, partner with a designer who can help this be more accessible to the layman." - IslandsOfGenius

#### Purely Positive
* "AI with ethics, I love this. " - AIn_t_So_Bad
* "Important project, please keep going!" - yowenti
* "The applicant has really good idea! He/she still needs a long journey!" - chic0815
* "let's build a better future!" - furiosa-253577
* "Great effort. Don't give up" - 090909123
* "Sounds interesting, keep it up!" - mirowtech

Since you requested constructive feedback, hereâ€™s what voters said when they chose another applicant:

* "The project is interesting but I can't tell from the description what its applications may be." - zelda-814465
* "Great idea. Would appreciate greater progress & Github and a description that would make this project forkable by anyone " - AIrtemis
* "Don't give up. Keep up the pace. All the best" - 090909123
* "Really impressive! Like that you're doing open source work! Sorry couldn't vote but, I did the first star :) . Look at decaNLP, might help! " - pranjal
