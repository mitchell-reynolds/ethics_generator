morality philosophical

nothing possibly conceived world even
called good without qualification except good
intelligence wit judgement talents mind
however may named courage resolution perseverance
qualities temperament undoubtedly good desirable many
respects gifts nature may also become extremely bad
mischievous make use
therefore constitutes called character good
gifts fortune power riches honour even
health general well contentment one
condition called happiness inspire pride often
presumption good correct influence
mind also rectify whole principle
acting adapt end sight
adorned single feature pure good enjoying
unbroken prosperity never give pleasure impartial
rational spectator thus good appears constitute
indispensable condition even worthy happiness

even qualities service good
may facilitate action yet intrinsic
unconditional value always presuppose good
qualifies esteem justly
permit us regard absolutely good moderation
affections passions self control calm deliberation
good many respects even seem constitute part
intrinsic worth person far deserving
called good without qualification although
unconditionally praised ancients without principles
good may become extremely bad coolness
villain makes far dangerous also directly makes
abominable eyes would without

good good performs effects
aptness attainment proposed end simply
virtue volition good
considered esteemed much higher
brought favour inclination nay even
sum total inclinations even happen owing
special disfavour fortune niggardly provision
step motherly nature wholly lack power accomplish
purpose greatest efforts yet achieve
nothing remain good
sure mere wish summoning means power
like jewel would still shine light thing
whole value usefulness fruitlessness
neither add take away anything value would
setting enable us handle
conveniently common commerce attract attention
yet connoisseurs recommend true
connoisseurs determine value

however something strange idea absolute
value mere account taken utility
notwithstanding thorough assent even common reason
idea yet suspicion must arise may perhaps really
product mere high flown fancy may misunderstood
purpose nature assigning reason governor
therefore examine idea point view

physical constitution organized
adapted suitably purposes life assume
fundamental principle organ purpose found
also fittest best adapted purpose
reason proper object nature
conservation welfare word happiness
nature would hit upon bad arrangement selecting
reason creature carry purpose
actions creature perform view purpose
whole rule conduct would far surely prescribed
instinct end would attained thereby
much certainly ever reason reason
communicated favoured creature
must served contemplate happy constitution
nature admire congratulate thereon
feel thankful beneficent cause
subject desires weak delusive guidance meddle
bunglingly purpose nature word nature would
taken care reason break forth practical exercise
presumption weak insight think
plan happiness means attaining nature
would taken choice ends
also means wise foresight would entrusted
instinct

fact find cultivated reason applies
deliberate purpose enjoyment life happiness
much man fail true satisfaction
circumstance arises many candid enough
confess certain degree misology hatred reason
especially case experienced use
calculating advantages derive
say invention arts common luxury even
sciences seem luxury
understanding find fact brought
trouble shoulders rather gained happiness
end envying rather despising common
stamp men keep closer guidance mere instinct
allow reason much influence conduct
must admit judgement would much lower
lofty eulogies advantages reason gives us regard
happiness satisfaction life would even reduce
zero means morose ungrateful goodness
world governed lies root
judgements idea existence different far
nobler end happiness reason properly
intended must therefore regarded supreme
condition private ends man must part
postponed

reason competent guide certainty
regard objects satisfaction wants
extent even multiplies end
implanted instinct would led much greater certainty
since nevertheless reason imparted us practical
faculty e one influence
therefore admitting nature generally distribution
capacities adapted means end true
destination must produce merely good means
something else good reason absolutely
necessary though indeed sole complete
good must supreme good condition every
even desire happiness circumstances
nothing inconsistent wisdom nature fact
cultivation reason requisite first
unconditional purpose many ways interfere least
life attainment second always
conditional namely happiness nay may even reduce nothing
without nature thereby failing purpose reason recognizes
establishment good highest practical destination
attaining purpose capable satisfaction
proper kind namely attainment end
end determined reason notwithstanding
may involve many disappointment ends inclination

develop notion deserves
highly esteemed good without view anything
notion exists already sound natural
understanding requiring rather cleared taught
estimating value actions always takes
first place constitutes condition rest order
take notion duty includes
good although implying certain subjective restrictions
hindrances however far concealing rendering
unrecognizable rather bring contrast make shine
forth much brighter

omit actions already recognized inconsistent
duty although may useful purpose
question whether done duty arise
since even conflict also set aside
actions really conform duty men
direct inclination performing impelled
thereto inclination case readily
distinguish whether action agrees duty done
duty selfish view much harder make
distinction action accords duty subject
besides direct inclination example always matter
duty dealer charge inexperienced
purchaser wherever much commerce prudent tradesman
overcharge keeps fixed price everyone
child buys well men thus honestly
served enough make us believe tradesman
acted duty principles honesty
advantage required question case
suppose might besides direct inclination favour
buyers love give advantage
one another accordingly action done neither duty
direct inclination merely selfish view

hand duty maintain one life
addition everyone also direct inclination
account often anxious care men take
intrinsic worth maxim moral import preserve
life duty requires doubt duty
requires hand adversity hopeless sorrow
completely taken away relish life unfortunate one
strong mind indignant fate rather desponding
dejected wishes death yet preserves life without
loving inclination fear duty maxim
moral worth

beneficent duty besides
many minds sympathetically constituted without
motive vanity self interest find pleasure
spreading joy around take delight satisfaction
others far work maintain
case action kind however proper however amiable
may nevertheless true moral worth level
inclinations e g inclination honour
happily directed fact public utility
accordant duty consequently honourable deserves praise
encouragement esteem maxim lacks moral import
namely actions done duty inclination put
case mind philanthropist clouded sorrow
extinguishing sympathy lot others
still power benefit others distress
touched trouble absorbed
suppose tears dead
insensibility performs action without inclination
simply duty first action genuine
moral worth still nature put little sympathy
heart man supposed upright man
temperament cold indifferent sufferings others
perhaps respect provided
special gift patience fortitude supposes even requires
others man would certainly
meanest product nature nature specially
framed philanthropist would still find
source whence give far higher worth
good natured temperament could unquestionably
moral worth character brought
incomparably highest namely beneficent
inclination duty

secure one happiness duty least indirectly
discontent one condition pressure many anxieties
amidst unsatisfied wants might easily become great temptation
transgression duty without looking duty
men already strongest intimate inclination
happiness idea inclinations
combined one total precept happiness often
sort greatly interferes inclinations yet
man form definite certain conception sum
satisfaction called happiness
wondered single inclination definite
promises time within
gratified often able overcome fluctuating idea
gouty patient instance choose enjoy likes
suffer may since according calculation
occasion least sacrificed enjoyment
present moment possibly mistaken expectation happiness
supposed found health even case
general desire happiness influence supposing
particular case health necessary element
calculation yet remains cases
law namely promote happiness inclination
duty would conduct first acquire true
moral worth

manner undoubtedly understand
passages scripture also commanded love
neighbour even enemy love affection
commanded beneficence duty sake may even though
impelled inclination nay even repelled natural
unconquerable aversion practical love
pathological love seated
propensions sense principles action tender
sympathy love alone commanded

second proposition action done duty derives
moral worth purpose attained
maxim determined therefore
depend realization object action merely
principle volition action taken place without
regard object desire clear precedes
purposes may view actions
effects regarded ends springs give
actions unconditional moral worth
worth lie consist reference
expected effect lie anywhere principle
without regard ends attained action
stands priori principle formal
posteriori spring material two roads
must determined something follows must
determined formal principle volition action done
duty case every material principle withdrawn


third proposition consequence two
preceding would express thus duty necessity acting
respect law may inclination object
effect proposed action respect
reason effect energy
similarly respect inclination whether
another approve another
sometimes even love e look favourable
interest connected principle
means effect subserve inclination
overpowers least case choice excludes
calculation words simply law
object respect hence command action done duty
must wholly exclude influence inclination every
object nothing remains determine
except objectively law subjectively pure respect
practical law consequently maxim follow
law even thwarting inclinations



maxim subjective principle volition objective
principle e would also serve subjectively
practical principle rational beings reason full power
faculty desire practical law



thus moral worth action lie effect
expected principle action requires
borrow motive expected effect effects
agreeableness one condition even promotion
happiness others could also brought
causes would need
rational whereas alone supreme
unconditional good found pre eminent good
call moral therefore consist nothing else conception
law certainly possible rational
far conception expected effect
determines good already present
person acts accordingly wait
appear first result



might objected take refuge behind
word respect obscure feeling instead giving distinct
solution question concept reason although
respect feeling feeling received
influence self wrought rational concept
therefore specifically distinct feelings former
kind may referred either inclination fear
recognise immediately law recognise respect
merely signifies consciousness subordinate
law without intervention influences sense
immediate determination law
consciousness called respect regarded
effect law subject cause
respect properly conception worth thwarts
self love accordingly something considered neither
object inclination fear although something
analogous object respect law
law impose yet recognise necessary
law subjected without consulting
self love imposed us result
former aspect analogy fear latter
inclination respect person properly respect law
honesty etc gives us example since also look
improvement talents duty consider see
person talents example law viz
become like exercise constitutes
respect called moral interest consists simply respect
law



sort law conception must
determine even without paying regard effect
expected order may called good
absolutely without qualification deprived
every impulse could arise obedience law
remains nothing universal conformity actions law
general alone serve principle e
never act otherwise could also maxim
become universal law simple
conformity law general without assuming particular law
applicable certain actions serves principle
must serve duty vain delusion
chimerical notion common reason men practical
judgements perfectly coincides always view
principle suggested let question example may
distress make promise intention keep
readily distinguish two significations
question may whether prudent whether right
make false promise former may undoubtedly often case see
clearly indeed enough extricate
present difficulty means subterfuge must well
considered whether may hereafter spring lie much
greater inconvenience free
supposed cunning consequences easily
foreseen credit lost may much injurious
mischief seek avoid present
considered whether would prudent act herein
according universal maxim make habit promise
nothing except intention keeping soon
clear maxim still based fear
consequences wholly different thing truthful
duty apprehension injurious consequences
first case notion action already implies law
second case must first look elsewhere see
results may combined would affect
deviate principle duty beyond doubt wicked
unfaithful maxim prudence may often
advantageous although abide certainly safer
shortest way however unerring one discover answer
question whether lying promise consistent duty
ask `` content maxim extricate
difficulty false promise hold good universal
law well others `` able say
`` every one may make deceitful promise finds
difficulty otherwise extricate
`` presently become aware lie
means lying universal law
law would promises since would
vain allege intention regard future actions
would believe allegation hastily
would pay back coin hence maxim soon
made universal law would necessarily destroy

therefore need far reaching penetration discern
order may morally good
inexperienced course world incapable
prepared contingencies ask canst thou also
thy maxim universal law must
rejected disadvantage accruing
even others enter principle
possible universal legislation reason extorts
immediate respect legislation indeed yet discern
respect based philosopher may inquire
least understand estimation
worth far outweighs worth recommended
inclination necessity acting pure respect
practical law constitutes duty every
motive must give place condition
good worth everything

thus without quitting moral knowledge common human
reason arrived principle although doubt
common men conceive abstract universal
form yet always really eyes use
standard decision would easy show
compass hand men well able distinguish
every case occurs good bad conformably duty
inconsistent without least teaching
anything new like socrates direct attention
principle employ therefore
need science philosophy know honest
good yea even wise virtuous indeed might well
conjectured beforehand knowledge every man bound
therefore also know would within reach
every man even commonest forbear admiration
see great advantage practical judgement
theoretical common understanding men latter
common reason ventures depart laws experience
perceptions senses falls mere
inconceivabilities self contradictions least chaos
uncertainty obscurity instability practical sphere
common understanding excludes sensible springs
practical laws power judgement begins show
advantage becomes even subtle whether
chicanes conscience claims respecting
called right whether desires
instruction determine honestly worth actions
latter case may even good hope hitting mark
philosopher whatever promise nay almost
sure philosopher
principle may easily perplex judgement multitude
considerations foreign matter turn aside right
way would therefore wiser moral concerns acquiesce
judgement common reason call
philosophy purpose rendering system morals
complete intelligible rules convenient use
especially disputation draw common
understanding happy simplicity bring means
philosophy new path inquiry instruction

innocence indeed glorious thing hand
sad well maintain easily seduced
account even wisdom otherwise consists conduct
knowledge yet need science order learn
secure precepts admission permanence
commands duty reason represents man
deserving respect feels powerful counterpoise
wants inclinations entire satisfaction sums
name happiness reason issues commands
unyieldingly without promising anything inclinations
disregard contempt claims
impetuous time plausible allow
suppressed command hence arises
natural dialectic e disposition argue
strict laws duty question validity least
purity strictness possible make
accordant wishes inclinations say corrupt
source entirely destroy worth
thing even common practical reason ultimately call good

thus common reason man compelled go
sphere take step field practical philosophy
satisfy speculative want never occurs
long content mere sound reason even
practical grounds order attain information clear
instruction respecting source principle correct
determination opposition maxims based
wants inclinations may escape perplexity
opposite claims run risk losing genuine moral
principles equivocation easily falls
thus practical reason cultivates insensibly arises
dialetic forces seek aid philosophy
happens theoretic use case therefore
well find rest nowhere thorough
critical examination reason

follow clearly describe practical faculty reason
general rules determination point notion
duty springs

everything nature works according laws rational beings
alone faculty acting according conception
laws according principles e since
deduction actions principles requires reason
nothing practical reason reason infallibly determines
actions recognised
objectively necessary subjectively necessary also e
faculty choose reason independent
inclination recognises practically necessary e good
reason sufficiently determine
latter subject also subjective conditions particular
impulses always coincide objective
conditions word completely
accord reason actually case men
actions objectively recognised necessary subjectively
contingent determination according
objective laws obligation say relation
objective laws thoroughly good conceived
determination rational principles
reason nature necessity
follow

conception objective principle far
obligatory called command reason
formula command called imperative

imperatives expressed word ought [ shall ]
thereby indicate relation objective law reason
subjective constitution necessarily determined
obligation say something would good
forbear say always
thing conceived good practically
good however determines means conceptions
reason consequently subjective causes
objectively principles valid every
rational distinguished pleasant
influences means sensation merely
subjective causes valid sense one
principle reason holds every one



dependence desires sensations called
inclination accordingly always indicates want
dependence contingently determinable principles reason
called interest therefore found case
dependent always conform reason
divine conceive interest human
also take interest thing without therefore acting
interest former signifies practical interest action
latter pathological object action former
indicates dependence principles reason
second dependence principles reason
sake inclination reason supplying practical rules
requirement inclination may satisfied first case
action interests second object action
pleasant seen first section
action done duty must look interest
object action rational
principle viz law



perfectly good would therefore equally subject
objective laws viz laws good could conceived
obliged thereby act lawfully subjective
constitution determined conception good
therefore imperatives hold divine general
holy ought place volition already
necessarily unison law therefore imperatives
formulae express relation objective laws
volition subjective imperfection
rational e g human

imperatives command either hypothetically
categorically former represent practical necessity
possible action means something else willed least
one might possibly categorical imperative would
represented action necessary without
reference another end e objectively necessary

since every practical law represents possible action good
account subject practically determinable
reason necessary imperatives formulae determining
action necessary according principle good
respects action good means
something else imperative hypothetical
conceived good consequently necessarily
principle conforms reason
categorical

thus imperative declares action possible would
good presents practical rule relation
forthwith perform action simply good
whether subject always know good
even know yet maxims might opposed
objective principles practical reason

accordingly hypothetical imperative says action
good purpose possible actual first case
problematical second assertorial practical principle
categorical imperative declares action objectively
necessary without reference purpose e without
end valid apodeictic practical principle

whatever possible power rational may
also conceived possible purpose therefore
principles action regards means necessary attain
possible purpose fact infinitely numerous sciences
practical part consisting problems expressing end
possible us imperatives directing may attained
may therefore called general imperatives skill
question whether end rational good
one must order attain precepts
physician make patient thoroughly healthy poisoner
ensure certain death equal value respect
serves effect purpose perfectly since early youth
known ends likely occur us course life
parents seek children taught great many things
provide skill use means sorts arbitrary
ends none determine whether may perhaps
hereafter object pupil events
possible might aim anxiety great
commonly neglect form correct judgement value
things may chosen ends

one end however may assumed actually
rational beings far imperatives apply
viz dependent beings therefore one purpose
merely may may certainty assume
actually natural necessity happiness
hypothetical imperative expresses practical necessity
action means advancement happiness assertorial
present necessary uncertain merely
possible purpose purpose may presuppose
certainty priori every man belongs
skill choice means greatest well
may called prudence narrowest sense thus
imperative refers choice means one happiness
e precept prudence still always hypothetical
action commanded absolutely means another
purpose



word prudence taken two senses one may bear
name knowledge world private
prudence former man ability influence others
use purposes latter sagacity combine
purposes lasting benefit latter
properly value even former reduced
man prudent former sense latter
might better say clever cunning
whole imprudent



finally imperative commands certain conduct
immediately without condition purpose
attained imperative categorical concerns
matter action intended result form
principle result essentially good
consists mental disposition let consequence
may imperative may called morality

marked distinction also volitions
three sorts principles dissimilarity obligation
order mark difference clearly think
would suitably named order said
either rules skill counsels prudence commands laws
morality law involves conception
unconditional objective necessity consequently
universally valid commands laws must obeyed
must followed even opposition inclination counsels
indeed involve necessity one hold
contingent subjective condition viz depend whether
man reckons part happiness
categorical imperative contrary limited
condition absolutely although practically necessary
may quite properly called command might also call first
kind imperatives technical belonging art second
pragmatic welfare third moral belonging free conduct
generally morals



seems proper signification word
pragmatic may accurately defined way sanctions
called pragmatic flow properly law
states necessary enactments precaution general
welfare history composed pragmatically teaches prudence
e instructs world provide interests better
least well men former time



arises question imperatives possible
question seek know conceive
accomplishment action imperative ordains
merely conceive obligation
imperative expresses special explanation needed show
imperative skill possible whoever wills end wills
also far reason decides conduct means power
indispensably necessary thereto proposition
regards volition analytical willing object
effect already thought causality
acting cause say use means imperative
educes conception volition end conception
actions necessary end synthetical propositions must
doubt employed defining means proposed end
concern principle act object
realization e g order bisect line unerring
principle must draw extremities two intersecting arcs
doubt taught mathematics synthetical propositions
know process intended
operation performed say fully
operation also action required analytical
proposition one thing conceive something
effect produce certain way conceive
acting way

equally easy give definite conception
happiness imperatives prudence would correspond exactly
skill would likewise analytical case
could said `` whoever wills end wills also
according dictate reason necessarily indispensable
means thereto power `` unfortunately
notion happiness indefinite although every man wishes
attain yet never say definitely consistently
really wishes wills reason
elements belong notion happiness altogether
empirical e must borrowed experience
nevertheless idea happiness requires absolute whole
maximum welfare present future circumstances
impossible clear sighted time
powerful supposed finite frame definite
conception really wills riches
much anxiety envy snares might thereby draw upon
shoulders knowledge discernment perhaps might
prove eye much sharper show much
fearfully evils concealed
avoided impose wants desires
already give concern enough would long life
guarantees would long misery would
least health often uneasiness body restrained
excesses perfect health would allowed one
fall short unable principle
determine certainty would make truly happy
would need omniscient therefore act
definite principles secure happiness empirical
counsels e g regimen frugality courtesy reserve etc
experience teaches average promote well
hence follows imperatives prudence strictly
speaking command present actions
objectively practically necessary rather
regarded counsels consilia precepts precepts reason
problem determine certainly universally action would
promote happiness rational completely insoluble
consequently imperative respecting possible
strict sense command makes happy happiness
ideal reason imagination resting solely
empirical grounds vain expect define
action one could attain totality series
consequences really endless imperative prudence
would however analytical proposition assume means
happiness could certainly assigned distinguished
imperative skill latter end
merely possible former given however
ordain means suppose willed end
follows imperative ordains willing means
wills end cases analytical thus
difficulty regard possibility imperative
kind either

hand question imperative morality
possible undoubtedly one one demanding solution
hypothetical objective necessity
presents rest hypothesis case
hypothetical imperatives must never leave
consideration make example words
empirically whether imperative
rather feared seem categorical may
yet bottom hypothetical instance precept
`` thou shalt promise deceitfully '' assumed
necessity mere counsel avoid evil
mean `` thou shalt make lying promise lest
become known thou shouldst destroy thy credit ``
action kind must regarded evil
imperative prohibition categorical show
certainty example determined merely
law without spring action although may appear
always possible fear disgrace perhaps also
obscure dread dangers may secret influence
prove experience non existence cause
experience tells us perceive
case called moral imperative appears
categorical unconditional would reality pragmatic
precept drawing attention interests merely
teaching us take consideration

shall therefore investigate priori possibility
categorical imperative case advantage
reality given experience [ elucidation ]
possibility requisite explanation
establishment meantime may discerned
beforehand categorical imperative alone purport
practical law rest may indeed called principles
laws since whatever necessary attainment
arbitrary purpose may considered contingent
time free precept give
purpose contrary unconditional command leaves
liberty choose opposite consequently alone carries
necessity require law

secondly case categorical imperative law
morality difficulty discerning possibility
profound one priori synthetical practical proposition
much difficulty discerning possibility
speculative propositions kind may readily supposed
difficulty less practical



connect act without presupposing
condition resulting inclination priori
therefore necessarily though objectively e assuming
idea reason possessing full power subjective motives
accordingly practical proposition deduce
willing action mere analysis another already
presupposed perfect connects
immediately conception rational
something contained



problem first inquire whether mere conception
categorical imperative may perhaps supply us also
formula containing proposition alone
categorical imperative even know tenor
absolute command yet possible require
special laborious study postpone last section

conceive hypothetical imperative general
know beforehand contain given condition
conceive categorical imperative know
contains imperative contains besides law
necessity maxims shall conform law law
contains conditions restricting remains nothing
general statement maxim action conform
universal law conformity alone imperative
properly represents necessary



maxim subjective principle action must
distinguished objective principle namely practical law
former contains practical rule set reason according
conditions subject often ignorance inclinations
principle subject acts law
objective principle valid every rational
principle ought act imperative



therefore one categorical imperative namely act
maxim whereby thou canst time
become universal law

imperatives duty deduced one
imperative principle although remain
undecided called duty merely vain notion yet
least shall able show understand
notion means

since universality law according effects
produced constitutes properly called nature
general sense form existence things far
determined general laws imperative duty may
expressed thus act maxim thy action become
thy universal law nature

enumerate duties adopting usual division
duties others
perfect imperfect duties



must noted reserve division duties
future metaphysic morals give
arbitrary one order arrange examples rest
understand perfect duty one admits exception favour
inclination merely external also internal
perfect duties contrary use word adopted
schools intend justify one
purpose whether admitted



1 man reduced despair series misfortunes feels wearied
life still far possession reason
ask whether would contrary duty
take life inquires whether maxim action
could become universal law nature maxim ``
self love adopt principle shorten life longer
duration likely bring evil satisfaction ``
asked simply whether principle founded self love
become universal law nature see system
nature law destroy life means
feeling whose special nature impel
improvement life would contradict therefore could
exist system nature hence maxim possibly
exist universal law nature consequently would
wholly inconsistent supreme principle duty

2 another finds forced necessity borrow money
knows able repay sees also nothing
lent unless promises stoutly repay
definite time desires make promise still
much conscience ask `` unlawful
inconsistent duty get difficulty way ``
suppose however resolves maxim
action would expressed thus `` think want money
borrow money promise repay although know
never `` principle self love one
advantage may perhaps consistent whole future welfare
question `` right `` change suggestion
self love universal law state question thus ``
would maxim universal law `` see
could never hold universal law nature would
necessarily contradict supposing universal
law everyone thinks difficulty
able promise whatever pleases purpose keeping
promise promise would become impossible well
end one might view since one would consider
anything promised would ridicule
statements vain pretences

3 third finds talent help
culture might make useful man many respects finds
comfortable circumstances prefers indulge
pleasure rather take pains enlarging improving
happy natural capacities asks however whether maxim
neglect natural gifts besides agreeing inclination
indulgence agrees also called duty sees
system nature could indeed subsist universal law
although men like south sea islanders let talents
rest resolve devote lives merely idleness
amusement propagation species word
enjoyment possibly universal
law nature implanted us natural instinct
rational necessarily wills faculties
developed since serve given sorts
possible purposes

4 fourth prosperity sees others
contend great wretchedness could help thinks
`` concern mine let everyone happy heaven
pleases make take nothing
even envy wish contribute anything
welfare assistance distress `` doubt mode
thinking universal law human race might well
subsist doubtless even better state everyone
talks sympathy good even takes care occasionally
put practice side also cheats
betrays rights men otherwise violates although
possible universal law nature might exist accordance
maxim impossible principle
universal validity law nature
resolved would contradict inasmuch many cases might
occur one would need love sympathy others
law nature sprung
would deprive hope aid desires

many actual duties least
regard obviously fall two classes one
principle laid must able maxim
action universal law canon
moral appreciation action generally actions
character maxim without contradiction even
conceived universal law nature far possible
others intrinsic
impossibility found still impossible
maxim raised universality law nature
since would contradict easily seen
former violate strict rigorous inflexible duty latter
laxer meritorious duty thus completely shown

subjective impossibility explaining freedom
identical impossibility discovering explaining
interest man take moral law nevertheless
actually take interest basis us call

interest reason becomes practical e cause

take interest thing irrational beings feel sensual
appetites reason takes direct interest action
universal validity maxims alone sufficient determine
interest alone pure determine

concluding remark



speculative employment reason respect nature leads
absolute necessity supreme cause world
practical employment reason view freedom leads also
absolute necessity laws actions
rational essential principle reason
however employed push knowledge consciousness
necessity without would rational knowledge
however equally essential restriction reason
neither discern necessity happens
ought happen unless condition supposed
happens ought happen way however constant
inquiry condition satisfaction reason
postponed hence unceasingly seeks
unconditionally necessary finds forced assume
although without means making comprehensible
happy enough discover conception agrees
assumption therefore fault deduction
supreme principle morality objection made
human reason general enable us conceive
absolute necessity unconditional practical law
categorical imperative must blamed refusing
explain necessity condition say means
interest assumed basis since law would cease
supreme law reason thus comprehend
practical unconditional necessity moral imperative yet
comprehend incomprehensibility fairly
demanded philosophy strives carry principles
limit human reason
