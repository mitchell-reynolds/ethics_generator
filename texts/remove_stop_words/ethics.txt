introduction metaphysical elements ethics

ethics ancient times signified moral philosophy philosophia
moralis generally also called doctrine duties
subsequently found advisable confine name part
moral philosophy namely doctrine duties
subject external laws german name tugendlehre
found suitable thus system general deontology divided
jurisprudence jurisprudentia capable external
laws ethics thus capable may let
division stand

exposition conception ethics

notion duty already notion constraint
free elective law whether constraint
external one self constraint moral imperative
categorical unconditional ought announces constraint
therefore apply rational beings may also
holy beings applies men rational physical beings
unholy enough seduced pleasure transgression
moral law although recognize authority
obey obey unwillingly resistance
inclination constraint properly
consists man free moral notion duty
contain self constraint idea law
look internal determination spring
thus possible combine constraint even
external freedom elective notion duty
must ethical one

{ introduction ^paragraph 5 }

man however time moral
considers objectively qualified pure
practical reason e according humanity person
finds holy enough transgress law unwillingly
man depraved transgression would
feel resistance abhorrence must put
force impossible explain phenomenon
parting ways beautiful fable places hercules
virtue sensuality man shows propensity obey
inclination law explain happens
tracing cause according physical laws
able conceive elective free mutually
opposed self constraint inevitability makes us recognize
incomprehensible property freedom

impulses nature contain hindrances fulfilment
duty mind man resisting forces
powerful must judge able combat
conquer means reason future
present simultaneously thought must judge
law unconditionally commands ought

power resolved purpose resist strong unjust
opponent called fortitude fortitudo concerned
opponent moral character within us virtue virtus
fortitudo moralis accordingly general deontology part
brings external internal freedom laws
doctrine virtue

{ introduction ^paragraph 10 }

jurisprudence formal condition external
freedom condition consistency maxim became
universal law law ethics contrary supplies
us matter object free elective end pure
reason time conceived objectively necessary
end e duty men sensible inclinations
mislead us ends matter elective
may contradict duty legislating reason otherwise guard
influence opposite moral end therefore
must given priori independently inclination

end object elective rational
idea determined action
production object may forced others actions
directed end means forced
end make something end
however also bound make something lies notions
practical reason end therefore besides formal
determining principle elective contained law
also material principle end opposed end
derived sensible impulses gives notion end
duty doctrine belong
jurisprudence ethics since alone includes
conception self constraint according moral laws

reason ethics may also defined system
ends pure practical reason two parts moral philosophy
distinguished treating respectively ends duties
constraint ethics contains duties observance one
physically forced others merely consequence
doctrine ends since forced
ends set one self contradiction

ethics doctrine virtue doctrina officiorum
virtutis follows definition virtue given compared
obligation peculiarity shown
fact determination elective except
end notion implies
even physically forced elective others
another may indeed force something end
means end another force make
end yet end except making
latter supposition would contradiction act freedom
yet time would free
contradiction setting one self end also
duty case constrain quite
consistent freedom end possible
question possibility notion thing
viz self contradictory enough prove
possibility thing objective reality notion



{ introduction ^paragraph 15 }

less man physically forced
morally forced mere idea duty much freer
man example sufficiently firm resolution
strong mind give enjoyment resolved
however much loss shown resulting therefrom yet desists
purpose unhesitatingly though reluctantly
finds would cause neglect official duty sick
father man proves freedom highest degree
thing resist voice duty





ii exposition notion end also duty



conceive relation end duty two ways either
starting end find maxim dutiful actions
conversely setting find end also
duty jurisprudence proceeds former way left
everyone free elective end choose
action maxim determined priori namely freedom
agent must consistent freedom every
according universal law

{ introduction ^paragraph 20 }

ethics however proceeds opposite way start
ends man may propose hence give
directions maxims adopt
duty would take empirical principles maxims
could give notion duty since categorical
ought root pure reason alone indeed maxims
adopted accordance ends selfish
could properly speak notion duty hence
ethics notion duty must lead ends must moral
principles give foundation maxims respect ends
ought propose

setting aside question sort end
duty end possible
necessary show duty kind called duty virtue
called

every duty corresponds right action facultas moralis
generatim duties imply corresponding right
facultas juridica another compel anyone
duties called legal duties similarly ethical obligation
corresponds notion virtue follow
ethical duties duties virtue fact
concern much certain end matter object
elective merely formal moral
determination e g dutiful action must also
done duty end also duty
called duty virtue hence several latter kind
thus distinct virtues contrary
one duty former kind one valid
actions one virtuous disposition

duty virtue essentially distinguished duty
justice respect morally possible
externally compelled latter whereas former rests free
self constraint finite holy beings even
tempted violation duty doctrine virtue
moral philosophy latter autonomy practical
reason whereas former also autocracy
includes consciousness indeed immediately perceived
rightly concluded moral categorical imperative power
become master one inclinations resist law
human morality highest stage yet nothing
virtue even quite pure perfectly free
influence spring foreign duty state poetically
personified name wise man ideal one
continually approximate

virtue however defined esteemed merely
habit expressed prize essay cochius
long custom acquired practice morally good actions
effect well resolved firm principles ever
purified like mechanical arrangement brought
technical practical reason neither armed
circumstances adequately secured change may
wrought new allurements

{ introduction ^paragraph 25 }



remark



virtue = + opposed logical contradictory
contradictorie oppositum negative lack virtue moral
weakness = 0 vice = contrary contrarie realiter
oppositum merely needless question
offensive one ask whether great crimes perhaps demand
strength mind great virtues strength mind
understand strength purpose man endowed
freedom consequently far master
senses therefore healthy condition mind great crimes
paroxysms sight makes man healthy mind
shudder question would therefore something like
whether man fit madness physical strength
senses may admit without
account ascribing strength mind mind
understand vital principle man free use powers
since crimes ground merely power
inclinations weaken reason prove strength
mind question would nearly question whether
man fit illness show strength healthy
condition may directly denied since want
health consists proper balance bodily
forces man weakness system forces
system alone estimate absolute health





{ introduction ^paragraph 30 }

iii reason conceiving end also duty



end object free elective idea
determines action object produced
accordingly every action end one end
without making object elective end
hence end actions act freedom
agent affect physical nature since act
determines end practical principle commands
means therefore conditionally end therefore
unconditionally hence categorical imperative pure
practical reason one therefore combines concept
duty end general

must end categorical imperative
corresponding since free actions must also
ends object actions directed amongst
ends must also time
notion duties none
since actions without end ends practical
reason might would valid means ends
categorical imperative would impossible supposition
destroys moral philosophy

therefore treat ends man actually makes
accordance sensible impulses nature
objects free elective laws objects
ought make end may call former technical
subjective properly pragmatical including rules prudence
choice ends latter must call moral
objective doctrine ends distinction however
superfluous since moral philosophy already notion
clearly separated doctrine physical nature present
instance anthropology latter resting empirical principles
whereas moral doctrine ends treats duties rests
principles given priori pure practical reason

{ introduction ^paragraph 35 }





iv ends also duties



perfection b happiness others

invert make one side happiness
perfection others ends
duties person

{ introduction ^paragraph 40 }

one happiness doubt end men
virtue impulse nature end without
contradiction regarded duty man
inevitably wills come notion duty
constraint end reluctantly adopted therefore
contradiction say man duty bound advance
happiness power

likewise contradiction make perfection another
end regard duty bound promote
perfection another man person
consists namely able set
end according notions duty contradiction
require make duty something






v explanation two notions



{ introduction ^paragraph 45 }

perfection



word perfection liable many misconceptions
sometimes understood notion belonging transcendental
philosophy viz notion totality manifold
taken together constitutes thing sometimes understood
belonging teleology signifies correspondence
properties thing end perfection former sense
might called quantitative material latter qualitative
formal perfection former one whole
belongs one thing one latter may
several one thing latter property
treat

said perfection belongs man generally
properly speaking humanity duty
make end must placed may effect
one deed merely endowment
thank nature otherwise would duty
consequently nothing else cultivation one
power natural capacity also one moral disposition
satisfy requirement duty general supreme element
former power understanding faculty
concepts therefore also concepts refer
duty first duty labour raise
rudeness nature animal nature
humanity alone capable setting ends
supply defects ignorance instruction correct
errors merely counselled reason
technically practical view purposes kinds
art reason morally practical absolutely commands
makes end duty order may worthy
humanity dwells secondly carry cultivation
purest virtuous disposition namely
law also spring dutiful actions obey
duty internal morally practical perfection
called moral sense special sense sensus
moralis feeling effect
legislative within exercises faculty acting
accordingly indeed often misused fanatically though
like genius socrates preceded reason even could
dispense judgement reason still moral perfection
making every special end also duty one end



{ introduction ^paragraph 50 }

b happiness others



inevitable human nature man wish seek
happiness satisfaction condition certainty
continuance satisfaction reason
end also duty writers still make
distinction moral physical happiness former
consisting satisfaction one person moral behaviour
one satisfaction
nature confers consequently one enjoys foreign
gift without present censuring misuse word even
involves contradiction must observed feeling
former belongs solely preceding head namely perfection
feel happy mere consciousness
uprightness already possesses perfection previous
section defined end also duty

happiness question duty
promote end must happiness men whose
permitted end hereby make also mine still remains left
decide shall reckon belonging
happiness power decline many things
reckon regard supposing
right demand plausible objection
often advanced division duties adopted consists
setting end supposed obligation study
physical happiness thus making natural
merely subjective end duty objective end requires
cleared

adversity pain want great temptations transgression
one duty accordingly would seem strength health
competence welfare generally opposed
influence may also regarded ends also duties
duty promote happiness merely make
others end case end happiness
morality agent happiness means removing
hindrances morality permitted means since one right
demand sacrifice immoral ends
directly duty seek competence one self indirectly
may namely order guard poverty
great temptation vice happiness
morality maintain integrity end
duty

{ introduction ^paragraph 55 }





vi ethics supply laws actions done

jurisprudence maxims action



notion duty stands immediate relation law even
though abstract every end matter law
shown formal principle duty categorical
imperative `` act maxims thy action might become
universal law `` ethics conceived law thy
general might others
latter case would give rise judicial duty
belong domain ethics ethics maxims regarded
subjective laws merely specific character
universal legislation negative principle
contradict law general law
maxims actions

{ introduction ^paragraph 60 }

notion end also duty notion peculiar
ethics alone foundation law maxims
actions making subjective end every one
subordinate objective end every one ought make
imperative `` thou shalt make thy end e
g happiness others `` applies matter elective
object since free action possible without
agent view end matter elective
follows end also duty
maxims actions means ends must contain
condition fitness possible universal legislation
hand end also duty make law
maxim whilst maxim
possibility agreeing universal legislation sufficient

maxims actions may arbitrary limited
condition fitness universal legislation
formal principle actions law abolishes arbitrary
character actions distinguished recommendation
one desires know best means end





vii ethical duties indeterminate juridical duties

strict obligation

{ introduction ^paragraph 65 }



proposition consequence foregoing law
command maxim actions actions
sign leaves observance latitude
latitudo elective definitely assign
much action towards end
also duty indeterminate duty meant permission
make exceptions maxim actions permission
limit one maxim duty another e g general love
neighbour love parents fact enlarges
field practice virtue indeterminate duty
imperfect accordingly obligation man
action closer nevertheless brings maxim
obedience thereto mind strict duty justice
much perfect virtuous action

hence imperfect duties duties virtue
fulfilment merit meritum = + transgression
necessarily demerit demeritum = moral unworth
= unless agent made principle conform
duties strength purpose former case alone properly
called virtue [ tugend ] virtus weakness latter case
vice vitium rather lack virtue [ untugend ] want
moral strength defectus moralis word tugend derived
taugen [ good something ] untugend etymology
signifies good nothing every action contrary duty called
transgression peccatum deliberate transgression become
principle properly constitutes called vice vitium

although conformity actions justice e
upright man nothing meritorious yet conformity maxim
actions regarded duties reverence justice
meritorious man makes right humanity
men end thereby enlarges notion duty beyond
indebtedness officium debiti since although another man
virtue rights demand actions shall conform
law demand law shall also contain spring
actions thing true general ethical
command `` act dutifully sense duty `` fix disposition
firmly one mind quicken former case
meritorious goes beyond law duty actions
makes law spring

reason duties also must reckoned
indeterminate obligation respect exists
subjective principle ethically rewards bring
near possible notion strict obligation principle
susceptibility reward according law virtue
namely moral pleasure goes beyond mere satisfaction
oneself may merely negative proudly
said consciousness virtue reward

{ introduction ^paragraph 70 }

merit merit man respect men
promoting natural ends recognized
men making happiness might call sweet
merit consciousness creates moral enjoyment
men sympathy inclined revel whereas bitter merit
promoting true welfare men even though
recognize case unthankful ungrateful
commonly reaction produces satisfaction
one self although latter case would even greater





viii exposition duties virtue intermediate duties



1 perfection end also duty

{ introduction ^paragraph 75 }

physical perfection cultivation faculties
generally promotion ends set us reason
duty therefore end
effort effect even without regard advantage
secures us based conditional pragmatic
unconditional moral imperative may seen following
consideration power proposing end
characteristic humanity distinguished brutes
end humanity person therefore combined
rational consequently duty deserving well humanity
culture generally acquiring advancing power carry
sorts possible ends far power found
man duty cultivate crude capacities
nature since cultivation animal raised
man therefore duty

duty however merely ethical indeterminate
obligation principle reason prescribes far one must go
effort enlarging correcting faculty
understanding acquisition knowledge technical
capacity besides difference circumstances
men may come makes choice kind employment
cultivate talent arbitrary
therefore law reason actions
maxim actions viz `` cultivate thy faculties mind body
effective ends may come thy way uncertain
may become thy ``

b cultivation morality greatest moral
perfection man duty duty
law rule also spring actions
first sight seems strict obligation
principle duty commanded merely legality every action
also morality e mental disposition
exactness strictness law fact law commands even
maxim action namely seek
ground obligation sensible impulses advantage
disadvantage wholly law action
commanded possible man see far
depth heart could ever thoroughly certain
purity moral purpose sincerity mind even
one single action although doubt legality
nay often weakness deters man risk
crime regarded virtue gives notion
strength many may led long blameless
life fortunate escaped many temptations
much element pure morality mental disposition
may belonged deed remains hidden even

accordingly duty estimate worth one actions
merely legality also morality mental
disposition indeterminate obligation law
command internal action human mind
maxim action namely strive
power dutiful actions thought duty
adequate spring

2 happiness others end also duty

{ introduction ^paragraph 80 }

physical welfare benevolent wishes may unlimited
imply anything case difficult
benevolent action especially done
friendly inclination love others duty expense
sacrifice mortification many appetites
beneficence duty results since self love
separated need loved others obtain
help case necessity therefore make
end others maxim never obligatory except
specific character universal law consequently
means also make others ends hence
happiness others end also duty

bound sacrifice others part welfare
without hope recompense duty
impossible assign definite limits far may go much depends
would true want according
feelings must left determine
one sacrifice happiness true wants
order promote others would self contradictory maxim
made universal law duty therefore
indeterminate certain latitude within one may
less without able assign limits definitely
law holds maxims definite actions

b moral well others salus moralis also belongs
happiness others duty promote
negative duty pain man feels remorse conscience
although origin moral yet operation physical like
grief fear every diseased condition take care
deservedly smitten inward reproach
indeed duty business nevertheless duty
nothing nature man might seduce
conscience may hereafter torment duty
give occasion stumbling definite
limits within care moral satisfaction others
must kept therefore involves indeterminate obligation





ix duty virtue

{ introduction ^paragraph 85 }



virtue strength man maxim obedience
duty strength known obstacles
overcome case virtue obstacles natural
inclinations may come conflict moral purpose
man puts obstacles way
maxims hence virtue merely self constraint
might effort one inclination constrain another
also constraint according principle inward freedom
therefore mere idea duty according formal law

duties involve notion necessitation law ethical
duties involve necessitation internal
legislation possible juridical duties hand one
external legislation also possible therefore
include notion constraint either self constraint constraint
others moral power former virtue action
springing disposition reverence law may
called virtuous action ethical although law expresses
juridical duty doctrine virtue commands us
regard rights men holy

follow everything virtue
properly speaking duty virtue former may concern merely
form maxims latter applies matter
namely end also conceived duty ethical
obligation ends may many indeterminate
contains law maxim actions end
matter object elective hence many
duties differing according difference lawful ends
may called duties virtue officia honestatis
subject free self constraint constraint
men determine end also duty

virtue coincidence rational every duty
firmly settled character like everything formal
one regards end actions also
duty regards matter one ought make end
may several virtues obligation maxim
called duty virtue follows also several duties
virtue

{ introduction ^paragraph 90 }

supreme principle ethics doctrine virtue `` act
maxim ends might universal law
everyone `` principle man end
well others enough permitted use
either others merely means would imply
might indifferent duty every man
make mankind general end

principle ethics categorical imperative
admit proof admits justification principles
pure practical reason whatever relation mankind oneself
others end end pure practical reason
faculty assigning ends general
indifferent take interest
contradiction since case would determine maxims
actions always involve end consequently would cease
practical reasons pure reason however command ends
priori except far declares also duty
duty called duty virtue





x supreme principle jurisprudence analytical

ethics synthetical

{ introduction ^paragraph 95 }



external constraint far withstands hinders
external freedom agrees general laws obstacle
obstacle thereto consistent ends generally
clear principle contradiction need go beyond
notion freedom order see let end may
accordingly supreme principle jurisprudence
analytical principle contrary principle ethics
goes beyond notion external freedom general laws
connects end makes duty principle
therefore synthetic possibility contained
deduction sec ix

enlargement notion duty beyond external
freedom limitation merely formal condition
constant harmony say instead constraint
without set freedom within power self constraint
help inclinations pure
practical reason scorns help consists
fact raises juridical duty ends
proposed jurisprudence altogether abstracts case
moral imperative supposition freedom
necessarily involves law power fulfil
rational determines maxim constitute elements
form notion juridical duty imperative
commands duty virtue added besides notion
self constraint end one
ought therefore pure practical reason
whose highest unconditional end however continues
duty consists virtue end
deserving well men also reward herein shines
brightly ideal human perceptions seems cast
shade even holiness never tempted
transgression however illusion arising fact
measure degree strength except
greatness obstacles might overcome
case inclinations led mistake subjective
conditions estimation magnitude objective conditions
magnitude compared human ends
obstacles overcome true worth
virtue end far outweighs worth
utility empirical ends advantages may
consequences



one might vary two well known lines haller thus

{ introduction ^paragraph 100 }

failings man still

better angels void



may indeed say man obliged virtue moral
strength although power facultas overcome
imposing sensible impulses virtue freedom must
presupposed yet power regarded strength robur
something must acquired moral spring idea
law elevated contemplation dignity pure law
reason us time also exercise

xii preliminary notions susceptibility mind

notions duty generally



{ introduction ^paragraph 135 }

moral qualities man possess
bound acquire moral feeling
conscience love one neighbour respect
self esteem obligation since
subjective conditions susceptibility notion duty
objective conditions morality sensitive
antecedent natural capacities mind praedispositio
affected notions duty capacities regarded
duty every man virtue
brought obligation consciousness
empirical origin follow moral law
effect mind



moral feeling



susceptibility pleasure displeasure merely
consciousness agreement disagreement
action law duty every determination
elective proceeds idea possible action
feeling pleasure displeasure taking interest
effect deed sensitive state affection
internal sense either pathological moral feeling
former feeling precedes idea law
latter may follow

{ introduction ^paragraph 140 }

duty moral feeling acquire
consciousness obligation supposes feeling order
one may become conscious necessitation lies
notion duty every man moral originally
obligation extend cultivation
strengthening even admiration
inscrutable origin effected showing
mere conception reason excited strongly
purity apart every pathological stimulus
improper call feeling moral sense word sense
generally means theoretical power perception directed
object whereas moral feeling like pleasure displeasure
general something merely subjective supplies
knowledge man wholly destitute moral feeling
totally unsusceptible sensation would morally dead
speak language physicians moral vital force could
longer produce effect feeling humanity
would dissolved chemical laws mere animality
irrevocably confounded mass physical
beings special sense moral good evil
truth although expressions often used
susceptibility free elective moved
pure practical reason law call
moral feeling



b conscience



similarly conscience thing acquired
duty acquire every man moral originally
within bound conscience would much
say duty recognize duties conscience
practical reason every case law holds man
duty acquittal condemnation consequently refer
object subject affecting moral feeling
act inevitable fact obligation
duty therefore said `` man conscience ``
meant pays heed dictates
really none would take credit anything done
according duty reproach violation duty
therefore would unable even conceive duty
conscience

{ introduction ^paragraph 145 }

pass manifold subdivisions conscience
observe follows said namely
thing erring conscience doubt
possible sometimes err objective judgement whether something
duty err subjective whether
compared practical judicially acting reason
purpose judgement erred would
exercised practical judgement case
neither truth error unconscientiousness want
conscience propensity heed judgement
man conscious acted according conscience
far regards guilt innocence nothing required
bound enlighten understanding
duty comes come action
conscience speaks involuntarily inevitably act conscientiously
therefore duty since otherwise would necessary
second conscience order conscious act
first

duty cultivate conscience quicken
attention voice internal judge use means
secure obedience thus indirect duty



c love men



{ introduction ^paragraph 150 }

love matter feeling volition
love still less ought
necessitated love hence thing duty
love benevolence however amor benevolentiae mode
action may subject law duty disinterested benevolence
often called though improperly love even
happiness concerned complete free
surrender one ends ends another even
superhuman love spoken also duty
duty necessitation constraint although may
self constraint according law done constraint
done love

duty good men according power whether
love duty loses nothing weight
although must make sad remark species alas
found particularly worthy love know
closely hatred men however always hateful even though
without active hostility consists complete aversion
mankind solitary misanthropy benevolence still remains
duty even towards manhater one love
show kindness

hate vice men neither duty duty mere
feeling horror vice influence feeling
feeling beneficence duty often
practises sees beneficent purpose succeed comes last
really love benefited therefore said
`` thou shalt love thy neighbour thyself `` mean
`` thou shalt first love means love
next place good '' `` good thy neighbour
beneficence produce thee love men settled habit
inclination beneficence ``

love complacency amor complacentiae would therefore
alone direct pleasure immediately connected
idea existence object duty
necessitated find pleasure thing
contradiction



{ introduction ^paragraph 155 }

respect



respect reverentia likewise something merely subjective
feeling peculiar kind judgement object
would duty effect advance considered duty
could conceived means respect
duty therefore would much
say bound duty duty therefore said
`` man duty self esteem `` improperly stated
ought rather say `` law within inevitably forces
respect feeling peculiar
kind basis certain duties certain actions
may consistent duty `` say
duty respect must respect
law within order able conceive duty






xiii general principles metaphysics morals

{ introduction ^paragraph 160 }

treatment pure ethics



first duty single ground obligation
two proof adduced certain mark
either valid proof yet given several
distinct duties regarded one

moral proofs philosophical drawn
means rational knowledge concepts like mathematics
construction concepts latter science admits
variety proofs one theorem intuition
priori may several properties object
lead back principle instance prove
duty veracity argument drawn first harm
lie causes men another worthlessness liar
violation self respect proved
former argument duty benevolence veracity
say duty required proved different one
giving variety proof one theorem
flatter multitude reasons compensate
lack weight taken separately
unphilosophical resource since betrays trickery dishonesty
several insufficient proofs placed beside one another
produce certainty even probability advance reason
consequence series sufficient reason
way force proof yet former
usual device rhetorician

secondly difference virtue vice sought
degree certain maxims followed
specific quality maxims relation law
words vaunted principle aristotle virtue mean
two vices false instance suppose good
management given mean two vices prodigality
avarice origin virtue neither defined
gradual diminution former vice saving increase
expenses miserly vices fact viewed
proceeding opposite directions met together
good management maxim
necessarily contradicts

{ introduction ^paragraph 165 }



common classical formulae ethics medio tutissimus ibis
omne mimium vertitur vitium est modus rebus etc medium
tenuere beati virtus est medium vitiorum et utrinque reductum
[ `` go safely middle '' virgil `` every excess
develops vice '' `` mean things etc `` horace
`` happy steadily pursue middle course '' `` virtue
mean two vices equally removed either '' horace ]
contain poor sort wisdom definite principles
mean two extremes assign avarice
vice distinguished frugality virtue merely
latter pushed far quite different principle
maxim namely placing end economy enjoyment
one means mere possession renouncing enjoyment
vice prodigality sought excessive
enjoyment one means bad maxim makes use
without regard maintenance sole end



reason vice defined excess
practice certain actions beyond proper e g
prodigalitas est excessus consumendis opibus less
exercise fitting avaritia est defectus etc
since way degree left quite undefined question
whether conduct accords duty turns wholly
account use definition

thirdly ethical virtue must estimated power
attribute man fulfilling law conversely moral
power must estimated law commands categorically
therefore empirical knowledge men
rational knowledge according ideas humanity
ought three maxims scientific treatment
ethics opposed older apophthegms

{ introduction ^paragraph 170 }

1 one virtue one vice

2 virtue observance mean path two opposite
vices

3 virtue like prudence must learned experience





xiv virtue general

{ introduction ^paragraph 175 }



virtue signifies moral strength exhaust
notion strength might also belong holy superhuman
opposing impulse counteracts law rational
therefore willingly everything accordance
law virtue moral strength man
obedience duty moral necessitation law
giving reason inasmuch constitutes power executing
law duty duty possess
otherwise duty bound duty
commands accompanies command moral constraint one
possible laws internal freedom since
irresistible strength requisite degree strength
estimated magnitude hindrances man
creates inclinations vices brood unlawful
dispositions monsters combat wherefore
moral strength fortitude fortitudo moralis constitutes
greatest true martial glory man also called
true wisdom namely practical makes ultimate
end existence man earth end possession alone
makes man free healthy rich king etc either chance fate
deprive since possesses virtuous
lose virtue

encomiums bestowed ideal humanity moral
perfection lose nothing practical reality examples
men probably hereafter
anthropology proceeds mere empirical knowledge
impair anthroponomy erected unconditionally
legislating reason although virtue may called
meritorious relation men law worthy
reward yet end also must
regarded reward

virtue considered complete perfection therefore regarded
man possessed virtue virtue possessed man
since former case would appear though still
choice would require another virtue order
select virtue wares offered conceive
plurality virtues unavoidably must nothing else
conceive various moral objects rational led
single principle virtue
opposite vices expression personifies contrivance
affecting sensibility pointing however moral sense
hence follows aesthetic morals part
subjective exposition metaphysic morals
emotions accompany force moral law make force
felt example disgust horror etc gives sensible
moral aversion order gain precedence merely
sensible incitement





{ introduction ^paragraph 180 }

xv principle ethics separated

jurisprudence



separation subdivision moral philosophy

common makes necessary divide duties

ethical hence internal freedom condition
ethical duty must discussed preliminary discursus
praeliminaris doctrine conscience discussed

{ introduction ^paragraph 185 }

remarks



doctrine virtue principle internal freedom



habit habitus facility action subjective
perfection elective every facility free
habit habitus libertatis custom assuetudo
uniformity action frequent repetition become
necessity habit proceeding freedom
therefore moral habit virtue therefore defined
habit free law abiding actions unless indeed add `` determining
action idea law '' habit
property elective rational
faculty adopting rule also declares
universal law habit reckoned
virtue two things required internal freedom master
oneself given case animus sui compos command
oneself imperium semetipsum subdue
emotions govern passions conditions
character indoles noble erecta opposite case
ignoble indoles abjecta serva

{ introduction ^paragraph 190 }





xvi virtue requires first command oneself



emotions passions essentially distinct former belong
feeling far coming reflection makes
difficult even impossible hence emotion called hasty animus
praeceps reason declares notion virtue man
collect weakness life one
understanding joined strength mental excitement
lack virtue untugend weak childish
thing may well consist best
one good thing storm soon subsides propensity
emotion e g resentment therefore closely related
vice passion passion hand sensible
appetite grown permanent inclination e g hatred contrast
resentment calmness one indulges leaves room
reflection allows mind frame principles thereon
thus inclination falls upon contradicts
law brood allow root deeply
thereby take evil set purpose one maxim
specifically evil true vice

virtue therefore far based internal freedom
contains positive command man namely bring
powers inclinations rule reason
positive precept command additional
prohibition namely allow
governed feelings inclinations duty apathy since
unless reason takes reins government hands
feelings inclinations play master man

{ introduction ^paragraph 195 }





xvii virtue necessarily presupposes apathy considered

strength



word apathy come bad repute meant
want feeling therefore subjective indifference respect
objects elective supposed weakness
misconception may avoided giving name moral apathy
want emotion distinguished indifference
former feelings arising sensible impressions lose
influence moral feeling respect
law powerful together
apparent strength fever patient makes even lively
sympathy good rise emotion rather degenerate
emotion called enthusiasm reference
explain moderation usually recommended
virtuous practices

{ introduction ^paragraph 200 }



insani sapiens nomen ferat aequus uniqui

ultra quam satis est virtutem si petat ipsam



horace [ `` let wise man bear name fool
unjust pursue virtue beyond proper bounds `` ]

{ introduction ^paragraph 205 }



otherwise absurd imagine one could wise
virtuous emotion always belongs sensibility
matter sort object may excited true strength
virtue mind rest firm deliberate resolution
bring law practice state health
moral life contrary emotion even excited
idea good momentary glitter leaves exhaustion
may apply term fantastically virtuous man
admit nothing indifferent respect morality
adiaphora strews steps duties
traps allow indifferent whether man eats fish
flesh drink beer wine agree micrology
adopted doctrine virtue would make rule
tyranny



remark



{ introduction ^paragraph 210 }

virtue always progress yet always begins
beginning former follows fact objectively
considered ideal unattainable yet duty
constantly approximate second founded subjectively
nature man affected inclinations
influence virtue maxims adopted
never settle position rest rising
inevitably falls moral maxims like technical
based custom belongs physical character
determination even practice become
custom agent would thereby lose freedom choice
maxims freedom character action done
duty

original intellectual conception duty moral

subjective principle responsibility one deeds god
nay latter concept contained though obscurely
every moral self consciousness
