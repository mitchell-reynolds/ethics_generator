Nothing can possibly be conceived in the world, which can be called good, without qualification, except a good will. Duty is the necessity of acting from respect for the law. The categorical imperative represent an action as necessary of itself without reference to another end as objectively necessary. Act only on that maxim whereby thou canst at the same time will that it should become a universal law. Act according to a maxim which can at the same time make itself a universal law. Act according to the maxims of a member of a kingdom of ends legislating in it universally.
